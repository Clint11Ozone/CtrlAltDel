only the html files are kept in the this folder. all other files should be placed in their respective folder. 'shift + >' opens up a online vscode editor containing all files in this repository. You can use the editor to make little changes to the code and push it to the repository. Note - This way is mainly just to view the code and make small changes since you cannot run the code.

To run the code, click on the green 'code' button and select the 'codespace for thriftstore project' codespace created. This is still an online vscode environment but allows you to run code and install extentions as you would in the desktop environment. (not sure but i think you can open it up in your desktops vscode as well)

For any changes made to a file, there will be an M symbol next to its name. The M symbol next to a file means file has been Modified and changes to the file has not been pushed to the repository yet. To do so open up source control tab (in the right navbar or ctr+shift+G) and click on 'commit & push' to save the changes made.
